## How much time did you spend on this project

> This project cost me 4 hours.

## Project overview

> Using the top-down design, the program unit is first defined, and then the syntax of each part of the program unit is defined separately.
> 1. Define the *token* and modify the scanner file.
>  2. Define operator precedence and associative direction.
>  3. Describes *Program Unit variable and constant declarations function declarations and definitions and statement* in a left-recursive manner.
>  4. Define all *terminal* in a recursive-free syntax.
> 5. To avoid conflicts, all grammar recursive definitions are defined in *non-terminal* grammars.

## What is the hardest you think in this project

> Determine whether the grammar rules need to be processed recursively.
