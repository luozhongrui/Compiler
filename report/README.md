## How much time did you spend on this project

This project cost me 6 hours.

## Project overview
In this project, the **scanner** is able to identify **Delimiter,Operator
Identifiers, Integer Constants, Floating-Point Constants,Scientific Constants, String Constants and Pseudocomments** as **token** and prints the recognized **token**. What's more, this **scanner** recognizes comments and spaces and ignores them. The options can be turned on or off based on the options already defined in the **pseudocomments**. Test cases all pass.

About the project implement,  complete the definition of regular expressions in section **definitions**. Specify the matching order in the **rules** section. Deal the replacement of  two consecutive double quotes to single quote in the **String Constants** in section **user routines**.

## What is the hardest you think in this project

There are some difficulties in handling escaped quotation marks in string matching.
