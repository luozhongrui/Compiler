## How much time did you spend on this project

> a week

## Project overview

> 1. Modify ASTNode to add the default type void to each node.
> 2. The type of each node is inferred from the terminal upwards.
>3. Each node iterates through all its children before performing a type check, and terminates the check if there are any errors in the subtree.
>4. Recursively perform all checks.

## What is the hardest you think in this project

> 1. The return statement determines that the statement does not belong to any of the functions.
> 2. The assignment statement determines that the variable reference cannot be a reference to a loop variable when the context is within a loop body.

## Feedback to T.A.s

> Not required, but bonus point may be given.
