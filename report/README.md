## Project overview
![](./assets/93c8bcf899c9b54f3e6abe1abd12484c0.png?0.9666239446067619)
> 1. As shown in the figure, implement all storage nodes and define internal node pointer variables. 
> 2. Each node is linked with a chain table.
> 3. Define visitor behavior in AstDumper for output printing.
> 4. All Ast nodes are constructed and the visitor is called to access them with access to the internal children.

## What is the hardest you think in this project

> How to link the next object chain table pointer, may be easier to use vector for storage.

## Feedback to T.A.s

> Not required, but bonus point may be given.
